# VOCAB-YOU-LARY

# Overview of Project
The sorting hat shows the houses and students that are in those houses, allows users to add a new student and after adding, it will randomly assign them a house and display that student by the house. If you choose to, you can "Expel" a student and send them to Voldemort's Army and they won't be a part of the house they were expelled from.
